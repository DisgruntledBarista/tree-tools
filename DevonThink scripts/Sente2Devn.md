# Sente 6 notes to DEVONthink 2

## FUNCTION  

### Copies notes (with tags/keywords and links to attachments) from the Sente 6 bibliography manager to DEVONthink 2.  

- For each bibliographic reference selected in Sente 6, a correspondingly named folder is created in DEVONthink   

- Sente notes are exported to the folder as RTF records. Any PDFs attached to the Sente bibliographic reference are also indexed in (and made searchable from) Devonthink.   

1. Following export, a new window is opened in DT2 to show the exported reference folders.  

2. The reference folders are normally created inside whichever folder is currently selected in DT2.  

3. If a database, but no folder, is selected, the references go to the root of the selected database.  

- If no active database is selected in DT2, the references go to the DT2 Global Inbox.  

## INSTALLATION  

### Save the .applescript text as a compiled .scpt  

(This script no longer requires XML Tools. It should run a little faster than the earlier drafts, which were based on SenteXML, and should be able to export a larger number of selected records in a single batch).  

## USAGE  

1. Open DEVONThink 2 (and, optionally, select a folder to receive the exports),  

2. Select one or more records in Sente 6,  

3. Run the script.
