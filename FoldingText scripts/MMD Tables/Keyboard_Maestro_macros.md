{{page.description}}

Place the cursor anywhere in a simple MD outline or a nested MMD table, and run one of these Keyboard Maestro macros.

The **→ Table** script can also be used to pretty-print or complete a partially specified MMD table (nested - with some parent cells spanning child cells - or flat/tabular)

The **→ Outline** script translates the nesting structure of the selected MMD table to an outline combining hash headings with tab-indented lists.


*Example of a source outline and a table generated from that outline (previewed in Marked):*
