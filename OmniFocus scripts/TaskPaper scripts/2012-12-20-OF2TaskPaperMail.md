## OmniFocus to TaskPaper exporter
### Creates TaskPaper formatted text from the current OmniFocus content panel selection.
---


Two applescripts which export whatever is selected in the right-hand content panel of OmniFocus to a plain Taskpaper format. (Any child nodes descending from the selection are also exported).

One script exports to a text file, the other exports straight to a fresh OS X Mail email.

(Originally drafted at a time when Omnifocus's own Taskpaper exporter contained bugs.
haven't checked that recently)

In addition to context and @done tags, it is also intended to output tags of the following form:

@start(yyyy-mm-dd) or @start(yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm) - Start date 
@due(yyyy-mm-dd) or @due(yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm) - Due date
@mins(nn) - Estimated minutes
@flag - Flagged
